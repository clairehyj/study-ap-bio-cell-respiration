A. Electron transport speeds up, proton pumping increases and ATP synthesis is stimulated because NADH is abundant.
B. Electron transport slows due to lack of oxidized carriers; proton pumping and ATP synthesis decrease despite succinate feeding complex II, because high NADH and low ADP limit overall flux ￼ ￼.
C. Succinate oxidation at complex II will fully compensate for the inhibited enzymes, increasing ATP synthesis and reducing the NADH/NAD⁺ ratio.
D. High NADH activates rotenone‑sensitive complex I, resulting in increased oxygen consumption.

B. At low temperature, malonate has little effect; at higher temperature, both the inhibitor and increased kinetic energy decrease O₂ consumption rate because complex II is inhibited and enzymes denature.
C. Malonate stimulates the citric acid cycle, increasing O₂ consumption at all temperatures.
D. Temperature has no effect on O₂ consumption when malonate is present because complex II is the only rate‑determining step.
	9.	Which combination of statements about fatty acid catabolism, the urea cycle and gluconeogenesis during starvation is accurate?
A. β‑oxidation supplies acetyl‑CoA and NADH to drive gluconeogenesis; amino acid deamination produces ammonia that enters the urea cycle, and fumarate generated in the urea cycle replenishes the citric acid cycle ￼ ￼.
B. β‑oxidation produces glucose directly; nitrogen from amino acids is excreted as uric acid; the urea cycle consumes NADH generated from ketone bodies.
C. Fatty acid oxidation supplies oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis; the urea cycle produces ketone bodies; gluconeogenesis occurs only in muscle.
D. β‑oxidation lowers acetyl‑CoA levels, inhibiting gluconeogenesis; ammonia is converted into urea via the electron transport chain.
	10.	A red blood cell (RBC) in the bloodstream encounters arsenate, an inhibitor that uncouples substrate‑level phosphorylation in glycolysis by mimicking phosphate.  Predict how ATP production, lactate formation and NAD⁺ regeneration will be affected in RBCs.

A. ATP production increases because arsenate supplies extra phosphate; lactate formation decreases because NADH is oxidized directly in the ETC.

B. ATP production decreases because arsenate bypasses the phosphoglycerate kinase step; lactate formation continues to regenerate NAD⁺ as pyruvate is reduced ￼ ￼.

C. ATP production is unaffected; arsenate acts only in mitochondria.

D. ATP production increases; lactate formation ceases and NAD⁺ accumulates.
	11.	Rotenone inhibits complex I of the ETC.  In an experiment, two sets of germinating seeds are placed in respirometers: one treated with rotenone, the other untreated.  Both respirometers contain KOH to absorb CO₂.  Predict the relative changes in volume inside the pipettes and explain the mechanism.

A. The rotenone‑treated respirometer will show an increased rate of gas volume decrease because electrons bypass complex I, enhancing O₂ consumption.

B. The rotenone‑treated respirometer will show a reduced rate of gas volume decrease because NADH cannot transfer electrons to the ETC at complex I; FADH₂ enters at complex II but pumps fewer protons, lowering O₂ consumption ￼.

C. Both respirometers will show identical rates because KOH absorbs CO₂.

D. The untreated respirometer will show no change in gas volume because CO₂ absorption by KOH prevents any movement of the fluid.
	12.	A liver cell in a fasted state is oxidizing fatty acids and performing gluconeogenesis.  If the ratio of ATP/ADP is high, how does this affect phosphofructokinase‑1, pyruvate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase activities, and what is the consequence for glucose production?

A. High ATP inhibits PFK‑1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase, leading to accumulation of acetyl‑CoA; citrate synthase is activated, funneling acetyl‑CoA into the citric acid cycle, reducing gluconeogenesis.

B. High ATP inhibits PFK‑1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase; citrate synthase slows because oxaloacetate is used for gluconeogenesis; this favors conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, stimulating glucose production ￼ ￼.

C. High ATP activates all three enzymes, boosting the citric acid cycle and decreasing gluconeogenesis.

D. ATP level has no effect on these enzymes, so gluconeogenesis proceeds independently of energy status.
	13.	In an experiment, mitochondria are isolated and provided with malate, ADP and inorganic phosphate.  Oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis proceed at a steady rate.  When citrate accumulates to high levels in the matrix, malate levels decline.  What effect will this have on the citric acid cycle and glycolysis in intact cells, and why?

A. High citrate inhibits PFK‑1 in the cytosol, slowing glycolysis; it also inhibits citrate synthase in the matrix, reducing citric acid cycle flux and causing malate to accumulate in the cytosol ￼.

B. Citrate activates PFK‑1, accelerating glycolysis and increasing NADH production.

C. Citrate directly increases malate production, enhancing the citric acid cycle and glycolysis.

D. Citrate has no regulatory roles in either pathway.
	14.	A plant cell receives strong light and has abundant ATP and NADPH from photosynthesis, but the Calvin cycle is limited by low CO₂.  How does this affect mitochondrial respiration, the malate valve and the balance between NADH and NAD⁺ in the matrix?

A. Mitochondrial respiration decreases; the malate valve exports excess reducing power from chloroplasts to mitochondria; NADH levels in the matrix rise, inhibiting the citric acid cycle.

B. Mitochondrial respiration increases; ATP synthase runs backward, pumping protons into the intermembrane space; NAD⁺ accumulates.

C. Chloroplasts import NADH from mitochondria via the malate valve; mitochondrial respiration stops.

D. The malate valve transfers ATP into chloroplasts; NADH levels remain unchanged.
	15.	Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to hemoglobin and also inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV).  In tissues exposed to CO, which processes are directly affected, and what are the consequences for ATP production and oxygen consumption?

A. CO prevents oxygen from reaching tissues but leaves complex IV unaffected; ATP synthesis continues via oxidative phosphorylation.

B. CO reduces oxygen delivery and inhibits complex IV; electron transport and proton pumping stop, leading to decreased oxygen consumption and cessation of ATP synthesis ￼.

C. CO acts as an uncoupler, increasing oxygen consumption and heat production.

D. CO stimulates complex II activity and increases FADH₂ oxidation.
	16.	During prolonged aerobic exercise, skeletal muscle gradually shifts from predominantly carbohydrate oxidation to increased fatty acid oxidation.  How does this shift affect the respiratory quotient (RQ), the ratio of NADH produced per carbon oxidized and the reliance on glycolysis?

A. RQ increases, NADH/CO₂ ratio decreases and glycolytic flux rises.

B. RQ decreases toward ~0.7, NADH per carbon oxidized remains similar but electron flow per O₂ increases; reliance on glycolysis declines as β‑oxidation provides ATP ￼.

C. RQ stays at 1.0, NADH/CO₂ ratio increases, and glycolysis accelerates.

D. RQ fluctuates randomly; these shifts have no effect on glycolysis.
	17.	A novel inhibitor blocks the ADP/ATP translocase in the inner mitochondrial membrane.  Predict the immediate effects on oxidative phosphorylation, proton gradient, electron transport rate and cytosolic ATP levels.

A. Oxidative phosphorylation continues; the proton gradient dissipates; electron transport speeds up; cytosolic ATP rises.

B. ADP cannot enter the matrix, so ATP synthase slows; the proton gradient increases; electron transport slows due to back pressure; cytosolic ATP levels fall.

C. Blocking the translocase increases ATP export; electron transport and proton pumping accelerate.

D. The inhibitor affects only substrate‑level phosphorylation; oxidative phosphorylation proceeds normally.
	18.	A cell line lacks glycerol‑3‑phosphate dehydrogenase in the cytosol.  Which processes will be impaired, and how will this influence the ATP yield from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation?

A. The malate–aspartate shuttle is blocked; cytosolic NADH cannot enter mitochondria, reducing ATP yield from glycolysis.

B. The glycerol‑3‑phosphate shuttle is non‑functional; electrons cannot pass to FAD in the inner membrane; ATP yield per cytosolic NADH increases because the malate–aspartate shuttle becomes dominant.

C. Beta‑oxidation is halted; pyruvate is converted exclusively to lactate.

D. Electron transport chain complexes are inhibited; ATP synthase reverses.
	19.	A scientist isolates mitochondria and provides succinate, rotenone and ADP.  Oxygen consumption is measured.  Compared with mitochondria supplied with malate and ADP without inhibitors, what differences in oxygen consumption and proton pumping would you expect, and why?

A. Oxygen consumption and proton pumping are similar because succinate oxidation at complex II and malate oxidation at complex I produce the same number of protons.

B. With succinate and rotenone, electrons bypass complex I; oxygen consumption continues but proton pumping decreases because complex II does not pump protons ￼.

C. Oxygen consumption stops because succinate oxidation requires complex I.

D. Proton pumping increases because complex II pumps more protons per electron than complex I.
	20.	A plant cell performs photorespiration when RuBisCO fixes O₂.  Describe how mitochondria are involved and how this process affects the overall energy balance compared with mitochondrial respiration.

A. Mitochondria convert glycine to serine, releasing CO₂ and NH₃; photorespiration consumes ATP and does not produce ATP, making it energetically costly compared with mitochondrial respiration.
