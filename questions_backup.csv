Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Correct Answer,Explanation
"Which statement best describes glycolysis in anaerobic muscle during intense exercise?","It converts two molecules of pyruvate into glucose while consuming two ATP and producing no NADH","It splits glucose into two pyruvate molecules, yielding a net of two ATP and two NADH, and regenerates NAD⁺ by reducing pyruvate to lactate","It occurs in mitochondria and yields 4 ATP per glucose but requires oxygen to regenerate NAD⁺","It oxidizes glucose completely to CO₂, producing the majority of ATP in aerobic respiration","B","Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, produces 2 net ATP and 2 NADH. In anaerobic conditions, lactate fermentation regenerates NAD⁺ to keep glycolysis running."
"What is the total number of NADH, FADH₂ and ATP molecules produced per glucose during pyruvate oxidation and the citric acid cycle combined?","2 NADH, 0 FADH₂ and 2 ATP","4 NADH, 2 FADH₂ and 2 ATP","2 NADH, 1 FADH₂ and 1 ATP","8 NADH, 2 FADH₂ and 2 ATP","D","Per glucose: Pyruvate oxidation produces 2 NADH (1 per pyruvate). Citric acid cycle produces 6 NADH, 2 FADH₂, and 2 ATP (doubled since 2 pyruvates enter). Total: 8 NADH, 2 FADH₂, 2 ATP."
"Why does NADH yield more ATP than FADH₂ in oxidative phosphorylation?","NADH donates electrons at complex I, which pumps protons, whereas FADH₂ donates at complex II, which does not pump protons","NADH carries twice as many electrons per molecule as FADH₂","FADH₂ is converted back to FAD in the cytosol, bypassing the electron transport chain","FADH₂ enters the electron transport chain at complex IV, which consumes ATP","A","NADH enters at Complex I which pumps protons. FADH₂ enters at Complex II which doesn't pump protons. This results in NADH generating ~2.5 ATP vs FADH₂ generating ~1.5 ATP."
"What process directly uses the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane to synthesize ATP?","Electron transfer from cytochrome c to oxygen","Substrate-level phosphorylation in the citric acid cycle","Oxidative phosphorylation via ATP synthase, whose rotor turns as protons flow through it","Conversion of lactate to pyruvate in the cytosol","C","ATP synthase uses the proton gradient created by the electron transport chain. Protons flow through ATP synthase, causing it to rotate and catalyze ATP synthesis from ADP + Pi."
"Under typical conditions, approximately how many ATP molecules are generated per molecule of glucose in mammalian cells during aerobic respiration?","2 ATP; because NADH produced in glycolysis cannot enter mitochondria","4 ATP; because electron transport is inefficient","30-32 ATP; because ATP yield varies depending on which shuttle transports cytosolic NADH into mitochondria","36-38 ATP; because FADH₂ yields the same number of ATP as NADH","C","The actual yield is 30-32 ATP due to: the malate-aspartate shuttle (yields full ATP) vs glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle (reduces yield), proton leak, and ATP used for transport processes."
"Which combination of effectors correctly describes regulation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1)?","Activated by high ATP and citrate; inhibited by AMP and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate","Inhibited by high ATP and citrate and low pH; activated by AMP and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate","Inhibited by AMP; activated by ATP","Activated by low pH; inhibited by AMP","B","PFK-1 is the key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis. It's inhibited by ATP, citrate (signals of sufficient energy), and low pH (lactic acid buildup). It's activated by AMP and F-2,6-BP (signals of low energy)."
"Which enzymes in the citric acid cycle are inhibited by high ATP and NADH levels?","Citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase","Isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase","Aconitase and malate dehydrogenase","Pyruvate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase","B","Isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase are key regulatory points. They're inhibited by ATP and NADH (energy abundance) and activated by ADP and NAD+ (energy need)."
"How does the availability of ADP influence oxygen consumption in mitochondria?","High ADP slows electron transport, decreasing oxygen consumption","High ATP stimulates proton pumping, increasing oxygen consumption","High ADP stimulates ATP synthase and accelerates electron flow and oxygen consumption","Oxygen consumption is independent of ADP concentrations","C","This is called respiratory control. High ADP stimulates ATP synthase, which uses the proton gradient. This allows electron transport to proceed faster, consuming more oxygen."
"Which statement best describes the fate of glycerol and fatty acids after triglyceride breakdown?","Glycerol enters gluconeogenesis as oxaloacetate; fatty acids are converted directly into glucose","Glycerol is deaminated to form ketone bodies; fatty acids undergo glycolysis","Glycerol enters glycolysis at dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and fatty acids undergo β-oxidation to yield acetyl-CoA units","Both glycerol and fatty acids are converted into lactate under anaerobic conditions","C","Glycerol is converted to DHAP (enters glycolysis/gluconeogenesis). Fatty acids undergo β-oxidation in mitochondria, producing acetyl-CoA which enters the citric acid cycle."
"Why is protein catabolism considered a last resort for energy production?","Because amino acids cannot be converted into citric acid cycle intermediates","Because removal of amino groups yields toxic ammonia and urea, and breaking down structural proteins compromises cell function","Because protein catabolism produces more ATP per carbon than fats","Because amino acids contain no energy in their carbon skeletons","B","Proteins are structural/functional molecules. Their breakdown produces toxic ammonia (must be converted to urea). Using proteins for energy means sacrificing important cellular components."
"In fermentation, how are NADH molecules reoxidized to NAD⁺ and why does fermentation yield so little ATP?","NADH transfers electrons to an inorganic acceptor; fermentation yields little ATP because proton pumping is uncoupled","NADH donates electrons to an organic molecule such as pyruvate or acetaldehyde, and because there is no electron transport chain, only the two ATP from glycolysis are produced","NADH is oxidized in the mitochondria; fermentation yields little ATP because oxygen consumption is high","NADH is converted into FADH₂; fermentation yields few ATP because FADH₂ produces less ATP","B","In fermentation, NADH is reoxidized by transferring electrons to organic molecules (pyruvate→lactate or acetaldehyde→ethanol). Without oxygen, no ETC operates, so only glycolysis ATP (2 net) is produced."
"Which statement about the Cori cycle is correct?","Lactate is produced in the liver and exported to muscle where it is converted to glucose","Lactate from muscle is converted to glucose in the liver via gluconeogenesis, consuming ATP, and the glucose is returned to muscle","The Cori cycle generates ATP in the liver and supplies it to muscle","The cycle converts lactate to ethanol in the liver","B","The Cori cycle: Muscle produces lactate during anaerobic glycolysis → Lactate travels to liver → Liver converts lactate to glucose (gluconeogenesis, costs 6 ATP) → Glucose returns to muscle."
"In a respirometer experiment, why is it necessary to include a vial with glass beads and KOH but no living tissue?","To provide extra volume for oxygen absorption","To measure the expansion of gases due to temperature and pressure changes and serve as a control for non-respiratory volume changes","To supply additional CO₂ for the germinating peas","To absorb oxygen from the atmosphere so that the seeds have less O₂","B","The control vial corrects for non-biological factors affecting gas volume (temperature, pressure changes). Any volume change in this vial is subtracted from the experimental vial to get true respiration rate."
"Which chemical reaction explains the role of KOH in a respirometer?","CO₂ + 2 KOH → K₂CO₃ + H₂O","2 KOH + O₂ → 2 KO₂ + H₂O","CO₂ + H₂O → H₂CO₃","CO₂ + O₂ → C₂O₄","A","KOH absorbs CO₂ produced by respiration: CO₂ + 2 KOH → K₂CO₃ + H₂O. This removes CO₂ from the gas phase, so only O₂ consumption causes volume decrease."
"How is oxygen consumption rate calculated from respirometer data?","By dividing total volume change by the number of seeds","By taking the slope of the line on a volume-versus-time graph; a steeper negative slope indicates faster respiration","By multiplying CO₂ production by oxygen concentration","By measuring the increase in gas volume over time","B","Oxygen consumption rate = change in volume / change in time. On a graph, this is the slope. A steeper negative slope means faster O₂ consumption, indicating higher respiration rate."
"Which stage of cellular respiration produces the most ATP?","Glycolysis","Pyruvate oxidation","Citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle)","Oxidative phosphorylation (Electron Transport Chain + ATP synthase)","D","Oxidative phosphorylation produces ~26-28 ATP per glucose, while glycolysis produces 2 ATP, and the citric acid cycle produces 2 ATP. Most ATP comes from the proton gradient driving ATP synthase."
"Where does glycolysis occur in the cell?","Mitochondrial matrix","Inner mitochondrial membrane","Cytoplasm","Outer mitochondrial membrane","C","Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of all cells. It doesn't require oxygen and is the most ancient metabolic pathway, present in all organisms."
"What is the net ATP gain from glycolysis per glucose molecule?","1 ATP","2 ATP","4 ATP","6 ATP","B","Glycolysis uses 2 ATP in the investment phase and produces 4 ATP in the payoff phase, resulting in a net gain of 2 ATP per glucose."
"Which molecule is the final electron acceptor in aerobic respiration?","NAD+","FADH₂","Oxygen","Carbon dioxide","C","Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. It accepts electrons and combines with protons to form water (O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O)."
"What is produced when pyruvate enters the mitochondria?","Glucose","Acetyl-CoA","Lactate","Ethanol","B","Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This process also produces CO₂ and NADH. Acetyl-CoA then enters the citric acid cycle."
