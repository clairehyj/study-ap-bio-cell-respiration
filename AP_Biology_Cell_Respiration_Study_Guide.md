## Overview of Cellular Respiration {#overview}

**Cellular respiration** is the process by which cells harvest energy from organic molecules (primarily glucose) and convert it into ATP through a series of metabolic pathways. The complete equation is:

**C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ~38 ATP**

### Key Stages:
1. **Glycolysis** - Cytoplasm, anaerobic, glucose → 2 pyruvate + 2 ATP + 2 NADH
2. **Pyruvate Oxidation** - Mitochondrial matrix, pyruvate → acetyl-CoA + NADH + CO₂
3. **Krebs Cycle** - Mitochondrial matrix, acetyl-CoA → CO₂ + NADH + FADH₂ + ATP
4. **Electron Transport Chain & Oxidative Phosphorylation** - Inner mitochondrial membrane, NADH/FADH₂ → ATP via chemiosmosis

## Answer Key {#answer-key}

### Glycolysis Answers

**Question 1:** The inhibitor would block glycolysis at the PFK step. a) ATP production would decrease to zero (net) since no ATP is made in later steps; b) NADH production would be zero; c) No pyruvate would form; d) Cell would be unable to survive anaerobically as fermentation requires pyruvate.

**Question 2:** B) Cytoplasm

**Question 3:** 3 glucose × 2 net ATP per glucose = 6 ATP net. Net gain differs from total because 2 ATP are invested per glucose in the energy investment phase, but 4 ATP are produced in the energy payoff phase.

**Question 4:** As oxygen decreases, cells shift from aerobic respiration to fermentation. Fermentation is less efficient (2 ATP vs ~38 ATP per glucose), so more glucose must be consumed to meet ATP demands. High lactate production at 0% O₂ confirms fermentation is occurring.

**Question 5:** Phosphofructokinase (inhibited by ATP, citrate) and pyruvate kinase (inhibited by ATP, acetyl-CoA)

**Question 6:** Glycolysis only requires NAD⁺, which can be regenerated by fermentation. The Krebs cycle requires continuous NAD⁺ regeneration through the electron transport chain, which needs oxygen as the final electron acceptor.

**Question 7:** a) Hypothesis: Aldolase mutation reduces glycolytic efficiency; b) Measure glucose consumption, lactate production, ATP levels in mutant vs. wild-type cells with proper controls; c) Reduced glucose consumption, lower ATP, possible metabolic intermediate accumulation; d) Measure flux using labeled glucose or real-time ATP measurements.

**Question 8:** 2.5 mM glucose × 2 net ATP per glucose = 5.0 mM ATP = 0.005 mol ATP per liter

**Question 9:** A) Two ATP molecules are consumed to phosphorylate glucose and fructose-6-phosphate

**Question 10:** Both are regulated by ATP (negative) and AMP (positive). PFK is the committed step so has more complex regulation including citrate inhibition. Pyruvate kinase is regulated by upstream products (acetyl-CoA) and uses feedforward activation by FBP.

### Krebs Cycle Answers

**Question 1:** After one turn: ¹⁴C would be in CO₂ (released from α-ketoglutarate → succinyl-CoA). After two turns: Label would be randomized throughout the cycle due to symmetrical intermediates.

**Question 2:** High energy charge would inhibit Krebs cycle. High NADH inhibits isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. High ATP and citrate provide additional negative feedback.

**Question 3:** B) 2

**Question 4:** 4 pyruvate → 4 acetyl-CoA (produces 4 NADH) + 4 turns of Krebs cycle (produces 12 NADH + 4 FADH₂). Total: 16 NADH + 4 FADH₂ = 20 reduced coenzymes.

**Question 5:** a) Measure O₂ consumption, CO₂ production, NADH/FADH₂ levels; b) Controls: no compound, known inhibitor/uncoupler; c) Use specific ETC inhibitors to isolate Krebs cycle effects; d) Inhibitor: decreased all parameters; Uncoupler: maintained O₂ consumption, decreased ATP.

**Question 6:** acetyl-CoA, oxaloacetate, citrate, citrate synthase

**Question 7:** Catabolic: breaks down acetyl-CoA for energy. Anabolic: provides precursors like α-ketoglutarate (amino acids), succinyl-CoA (heme), oxaloacetate (aspartate), acetyl-CoA (fatty acids).

**Question 8:** a) Reduced FADH₂ production, possible succinate accumulation; b) Alternative pathways, increased other dehydrogenases; c) Lower ATP yield (~30 instead of ~38 per glucose); d) FADH₂ helps regenerate antioxidants.

**Question 9:** False. Krebs cycle produces 1 ATP (GTP) per turn vs. 2 ATP net from glycolysis.

**Question 10:** β-oxidation produces acetyl-CoA that feeds into Krebs cycle. Fatty acid oxidation increases acetyl-CoA and citrate, which inhibit glycolysis (glucose-fatty acid cycle).

### Electron Transport Chain Answers

**Question 1:** C) Oxygen

**Question 2:** a) ETC pumps protons from matrix to intermembrane space; b) ATP synthase has rotor mechanism driven by proton flow; c) Proton-motive force drives ATP synthesis; d) DNP allows protons to bypass ATP synthase, dissipating energy as heat.

**Question 3:** 10 NADH × 2.5 + 2 FADH₂ × 1.5 + 2 substrate-level ATP + 2 GTP - 2 ATP transport cost = ~30-32 ATP per glucose

**Question 4:** Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase), Complex III (cytochrome reductase), Complex IV (cytochrome oxidase) pump protons; Complex II transfers electrons to CoQ.

**Question 5:** Low O₂ without ADP shows basic electron transport; High with ADP+Pi shows coupled respiration; DNP uncouples, increasing O₂ consumption; Oligomycin blocks ATP synthesis.

**Question 6:** a) Blocked; b) Decreased; c) Yes, succinate enters at Complex II; d) Gradient would dissipate without electron flow.

**Question 7:** a) Prokaryotes use cell membrane vs. mitochondrial membranes; b) Protons pumped across cell membrane vs. inner mitochondrial membrane; c) Similar ATP synthase structure; d) Prokaryotes may be more efficient due to no transport costs.

**Question 8:** chemiosmosis or oxidative phosphorylation

**Question 5:** a) C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₂H₅OH + 2CO₂; b) C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₃H₆O₃

**Question 6:** a) Fermentation evolved first as early Earth was anaerobic; b) Low oxygen, high organic matter; c) Fast reproduction, anaerobic niches; d) Lower energy yield but independence from oxygen.

**Question 7:** Initial increase with sugar concentration up to optimal level, then decrease due to osmotic stress and product inhibition at high concentrations.

**Question 8:** False. Fermentation produces the same net ATP as glycolysis (2 ATP per glucose) since it only regenerates NAD⁺.

**Question 9:** a) Ethanol toxicity inhibits yeast enzymes; b) Continuous removal, resistant strains, immobilized enzymes; c) Engineer alcohol tolerance, improve enzyme efficiency; d) Waste management, energy efficiency.
